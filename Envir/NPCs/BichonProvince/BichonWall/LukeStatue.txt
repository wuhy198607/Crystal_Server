#SAY
125 people die by suicide in the UK every week. 
Thats not okay. Thats why this October, Im 
taking part in CALMs Lost Hours Walk, to join 
people across the country in smashing the 
silence around suicide. The money I raise will 
be going towards CALMs life-saving services, 
so they can be there for anyone struggling, 
no matter what.

We know talking about suicide can seem 
awkward and uncomfortable - but it could also 
be the most important conversation you ever have.
Anyone can feel suicidal. But every one of us 
can help save a life.

-Liam Thompson
