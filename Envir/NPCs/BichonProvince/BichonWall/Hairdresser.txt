I am the local hairdresser, specialized in the cutting hair.
I have been sent here to check the living conditions of people.
Unfortunately, it seems that many people are still suffering from
poverty and can't afford to get a hair cut.
I'm happy to do it for 20,000 gold.

However I must warn you, you will need to relog after changing your hair.
