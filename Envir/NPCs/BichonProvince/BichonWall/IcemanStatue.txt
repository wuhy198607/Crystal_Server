Iceman was a pillar of the LOMCN community since he joined
in 2003, He released multiple servers throughout his time with us.

He created his own Mir 2 Files from Crystal and called it Eden Elite,
the files have been used and will continue to be used by many.
Giving hundreds around the globe enjoyment of a beloved game,
Sadly on 05/05/2023 at 4:12pm EST he passed away after a hard battle
with sepsis.

Iceman was a kind and loving gentleman that will be missed by hundreds,
may he live on within our community.
