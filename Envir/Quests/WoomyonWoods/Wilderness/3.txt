You remind me of my granschild. She went to
{Bichon/Yellow} to make money. I heard she was working
at a butcher's store. Could you let her know that
I'm doing well?

[@TaskDescription]
Talk to {Sarah/LimeGreen} in {BichonWall/Yellow}.

[@Completion]
Thankyou traveller. I was getting worried about
my grandad.
